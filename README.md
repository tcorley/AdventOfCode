# Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com)

So far solutions are in Javascript, but I will add solutions in other languages as well.

# Prerequisites

- `node` >= 12

# How to Run solutions

Navigate to a day

```zsh
$> cd 2020/day1
```

then run `node`:

```zsh
$> node .
```

Since each day has 2 problems, there will either be 2 outputs or a commented out section for part 1 or part 2.

Each prompt is linked in the solution header.
